## Motivation

When a clinician opens 3D Slicer, the goal is already clear. But turning that intent into results means navigating a dense UI, hunting through documentation, switching between segmentation tools and 3D views, and manually tuning dozens of parameters. The input data and desired outcome are certain; it is the execution path that is burdensome.

SlicerAIAgent closes this gap by letting clinicians state their goal in plain language and handling the rest end to end: searching the Slicer knowledge base for the right APIs, confirming exact function signatures, generating executable Python code, and running it directly inside Slicer to manipulate the scene. No scripting, no menu diving, no parameter guessing. This points toward a broader shift in medical software — from learning complex interfaces to simply stating intent and letting the agent operate the application on the user's behalf.

## Demos

### Demo 1 — Multi-Turn Segmentation, Reconstruction, and Plane Cutting

**Turn 1:** load the example CT chest volume

**Turn 2:** segment it with threshold from -200 to 1000, reconstruct the 3D shape

**Turn 3:** cut the 3D shape into two parts with a random plane, and different part shown with different color

**Turn 4:** give a random displacement to one part to separate them

[![Demo 1](https://img.youtube.com/vi/YO2A-mG7bn8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YO2A-mG7bn8)

The agent carries out a multi-turn interactive workflow: loading data → threshold-based segmentation → 3D surface reconstruction (`vtkMarchingCubes`) → arbitrary plane clipping → multi-color display → random displacement to separate the clipped parts.

---

### Demo 2 — Multi-Turn Anatomical Segmentation

**Turn 1:** load an example CT volume

**Turn 2:** segment the bone

**Turn 3:** segment the left lung

[![Demo 2](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Vzs-V0JspsU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vzs-V0JspsU)

> **Note:** The segmentation inference uses SlicerVoxTell. When running on CPU the inference time is very long, so those waiting segments were removed during video editing.

The agent performs a multi-turn segmentation workflow on a CT chest volume, isolating distinct anatomical structures through separate conversational turns.

## Technical Approach

SlicerAIAgent is not a simple "prompt → code" wrapper. It implements a **role-composed agent pipeline** that combines dense vector retrieval, autonomous tool calling, structured planning, AST-based security validation, safe execution inside Slicer's own Python interpreter, and automatic self-correction on failure.

### 1. Role Model

Every user prompt travels through an agent workflow with explicit internal roles. These roles are encoded in the system prompt, status UI, debug logs, and role trace, but they do not require separate LLM calls for every role.

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Observer** | Reads the user request and current MRML scene context. |
| **Retriever** | Uses dense retrieval and search/read tools to ground important Slicer APIs. |
| **Planner** | Produces a structured `agent_plan` with task summary, overall confidence, risk, and assumptions. |
| **Programmer** | Produces the complete executable Python block. |
| **Safety Critic** | Validates the plan and code, blocks unsafe operations, and logs warnings for high-risk actions. |
| **Executor** | Runs the code on Slicer's Qt main thread. |
| **Repairer** | Performs isolated self-correction if validation or execution fails. |

### 2. End-to-End Request Flow

The request flow below is ordered by runtime execution. Each section names the role or roles it implements, then gives the technical details for that part of the pipeline. Some roles are lightweight and appear through prompt constraints, validation checks, UI state, and debug artifacts rather than separate LLM calls.

#### 2.1 Context Grounding — Observer and Retriever

The Observer reads the user request and current MRML scene context. The Retriever then grounds the request against local Slicer knowledge before final code generation.

##### Dense Vector Pre-Retrieval (RAG)

Before the LLM ever sees the prompt, the system performs an **intelligent multi-retrieval** pass over a local dense vector index built from the Slicer knowledge base (`Resources/Skills/slicer-skill-full/`).

Retrieval is implemented as follows:

1. **Query Decomposition** — The `LLMClient.decomposeQuery()` method analyzes the user request. Simple requests (fewer than 12 words, no commas, at most one "and") are kept as-is. Complex multi-step requests are broken into 2–5 independent sub-queries via a lightweight LLM call. This ensures each sub-task gets its own focused semantic search.

2. **Per-Sub-Query Vector Search** — For each sub-query, `VectorRetriever.search()` runs a pure dense vector search against a FAISS `IndexFlatIP` index. The embedding model is `jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-code` (768-dim) running via ONNX Runtime with GPU provider auto-detection (CUDA, DirectML, ROCm, CoreML, or CPU fallback). Each sub-query retrieves the top-10 most relevant chunks.

3. **Source-Type Weighting** — Retrieved chunks are re-ranked by a source-type multiplier:
   - `doc_example` × 1.3 (official cookbook examples)
   - `python_api` × 1.2 (`slicer.util`, core Python API)
   - `effect_implementation` / `scripted_module` × 1.1
   - `test_example` × 1.05
   - `source` × 1.0

4. **Smart Full-File Inclusion** — If a markdown file contributes 5 or more chunks to the concatenated result, the system replaces all individual chunks from that file with a single synthetic "whole file" chunk. This avoids redundant snippet injection when an entire topic file (e.g., `segmentations.md`) is highly relevant.

5. **Context Injection** — The formatted retrieval results, along with a "search coverage" note listing the sub-queries, are injected into the system prompt under the heading `## RELEVANT KNOWLEDGE BASE SNIPPETS`. The LLM is instructed to treat these snippets as its first source of truth and to avoid re-searching the same topics.

If the vector index is missing or not ready, this retrieval mechanism silently skips itself and the system falls back to the traditional pure tool-calling workflow.

##### Autonomous Tool-Calling Loop

After pre-retrieval, the LLM is given **five tools** from the start: `SearchSymbol`, `Grep`, `ReadFile`, `VectorSearch`, and `GenerateSegmentationCode`. The LLM autonomously decides the best path to a solution, so no manual staged orchestration is required.

The tool loop has three main operations:

1. **Search** — The LLM may call `Grep` or `SearchSymbol` to locate relevant APIs across the skill knowledge base. Multiple tool calls are executed in parallel via a `ThreadPoolExecutor`.

2. **Read** — Once promising files are identified, the LLM calls `ReadFile` to confirm exact function signatures and usage patterns. `ReadFile` implements **smart slicing** to keep token usage low:
   - Files under 500 lines → full content.
   - Markdown files ≥500 lines → heading-based query matching.
   - Code files ≥500 lines → AST boundary extraction (complete function/class bodies via tree-sitter) or ±100-line grep-context fallback.
   - Python test files → test-method slicing (precise `def test_*` / `def TestSection_*` boundaries).
   - Duplicate read detection warns the LLM if it re-reads the same file with the same query.
   - Gist dead-end detection flags sections that contain only external gist links with no local executable examples.

3. **Generate** — When the LLM has enough information, it must output two fenced blocks in order: a structured ` ```agent_plan ` JSON block followed by a complete ` ```python ` code block. The tool loop terminates when executable code is detected. If the LLM reaches the maximum tool rounds without generating code, the system appends a force-generate user message that still requires both `agent_plan` and Python code.

For anatomical segmentation requests, the LLM may call `GenerateSegmentationCode` to obtain a ready-to-run VoxTell snippet (including GPU detection and model-path resolution) that is embedded directly into the final executable block.

**Conversation history management:** Full tool results are used within the current turn, but before persisting to `conversation_history`, they are compressed via `_compressToolResultsForHistory()`. ReadFile content is passed through (already sliced at the tool layer), Grep results are kept as-is, and VectorSearch drops the large `formatted_context` field. This prevents context bloat across multi-turn conversations. History is also subject to FIFO character-based trimming (500K character limit), dropping the oldest messages first.

#### 2.2 Plan and Code Generation — Planner and Programmer

Before code execution, the assistant response must include a valid parsed `agent_plan`. The plan contains:

- `task_summary`
- `overall_confidence`
- `steps`
- `risk_level`
- `requires_confirmation`
- `unverified_assumptions`

Each step includes an action, API evidence, confidence, and assumptions. The agent does not enforce machine-checkable scene expectations.

#### 2.3 Validation and Execution — Safety Critic and Executor

Generated code is **auto-executed** without requiring a manual button press.

##### Pre-Validation

- The parsed `agent_plan` must be valid before auto-execution.
- `CodeValidator` parses the code with the Python `ast` module.
- It blocks imports from dangerous modules (`os`, `subprocess`, `sys`, `socket`, `urllib`, `ctypes`, `pickle`, etc.).
- It blocks dangerous function calls (`eval`, `exec`, `compile`, `open`, `getattr`, `globals`, etc.).
- It detects potentially destructive operations (`RemoveNode`, `Clear`, `Delete`, `saveNode`, etc.) and flags them for confirmation.
- If plan or code validation fails, the system enters self-correction directly without attempting execution.

##### Execution

- `SafeExecutor.execute()` runs the code in `sys.modules['__main__'].__dict__`, which is the **exact same namespace** as the Slicer Python Console. This means shortcuts like `getNode` (injected by `slicerqt.py`) are automatically available.
- Execution is scheduled via `qt.QTimer.singleShot(10, ...)` to stay on the Qt main thread, satisfying MRML scene and GUI thread-safety requirements.
- stdout and stderr are captured with `contextlib.redirect_stdout/stderr`.
- VTK C++ errors are intercepted by temporarily replacing the global `vtkOutputWindow` with a `vtkFileOutputWindow` pointing to a temp file. After execution, the log is read back, prefixed with `[VTK ERROR]` or `[VTK WARNING]`, and injected into the captured stderr. This allows the self-correction mechanism to react to runtime VTK errors even when no Python exception was raised.

##### Scene Rollback on Failure

- Before execution, the system calls `slicer.mrmlScene.SaveStateForUndo()`.
- It also snapshots the set of existing node IDs.
- If execution raises an exception or times out, it calls `slicer.mrmlScene.Undo()` and then deletes any nodes whose IDs did not exist before execution (catching display nodes, storage nodes, and subject-hierarchy items that `Undo()` may miss because their `UndoEnabled` flag is `False`).
- The original undo flag is restored regardless of outcome.

#### 2.4 Self-Correction and Recovery — Repairer

If execution fails, times out, or produces clear error indicators in stdout/stderr (`traceback`, `exception`, `failed`), the agent automatically enters **self-correction mode**.

The correction loop works as follows:

1. An **isolated retry** is launched in a background thread via `chatWithToolsIsolated()`. This method runs the full tool-calling loop but does **not** read from or write to the main `conversation_history`, and it does **not** increment `turn_number`. Failed attempts therefore never pollute the user's conversation context.

2. The isolated prompt is constructed from:
   - The original system prompt (with current MRML scene context).
   - The original user prompt.
   - The prior tool trajectory from the failed attempt (assistant + tool messages), so the LLM does not fix blind.
   - The previous `agent_plan`.
   - The failed code block.
   - A user message containing the exact error and instructions to fix it.

3. The LLM may use tools again during correction (up to 5 tool rounds) to verify API signatures if the error suggests an incorrect call.

4. If correction succeeds, the corrected `agent_plan` and code are saved, the corrected code replaces the failed code in `conversation_history`, a correction marker is appended, and the new code is auto-executed.

5. This repeats up to **5 attempts total**. If all attempts fail, the agent reports the final error to the user.

### 3. Streaming & Real-Time Feedback

Because MRML scene access and all UI updates must happen on the Qt main thread, HTTP I/O runs in a background `threading.Thread`, while UI updates are marshaled back via a thread-safe `queue.Queue`.

**Mechanism:**

- A `_streamQueue` is filled by the worker thread with events: `delta`, `complete`, `error`, `correction_complete`, `correction_error`, and `status`.
- A `QTimer` polls the queue every **50 ms** on the main thread and drains all pending events in a batch.
- Consecutive streaming deltas (reasoning/content) are batched into a single render pass to avoid calling `setHtml()` hundreds of times per second, which would block the main thread.
- Tool progress deltas are committed immediately as separate chat entries so the user sees search activity in real time.

**UI elements:**
- **Thinking timer (⏱)** — Updates every 100 ms while the LLM is working.
- **Role-aware status label** — Shows the active role and current activity, such as `Observer: Reading request...`, `Retriever: Searching...`, `Planner/Programmer: Generating...`, `Safety Critic: Validating code...`, or `Executor: Executing...`.
- **Token/cost label** — Displays per-turn cumulative token usage and estimated cost (e.g., `Turn 3 | Cumulative: 4,231 tokens | $0.0123`).

**Debug artifacts** are written under timestamped run folders:

```text
logs/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_turnN/
```

Common artifacts include:
- `{turn}_agent_plan.json` — Parsed structured plan.
- `{turn}_code.txt` — Generated Python code.
- `{turn}_first_prompt_debug.txt` — First prompt/messages sent to the LLM.
- `{turn}_last_prompt_debug.txt` — Final prompt/messages before code generation.
- `{turn}_performance_log.txt` — Detailed timing breakdown for scene context, retrieval, API wait, tool execution, validation, execution, and self-correction.
- `{turn}_role_trace.json` — Structured role-composed pipeline events.
- `{turn}_thinking_history.txt` — Reasoning/progress content when available.

Correction artifacts use suffixes such as `{turn}_correction_1_code.txt` and `{turn}_correction_1_agent_plan.json`.

### 4. Dense Vector Retrieval Backend

The `SkillIndexer.py` module implements a complete dense retrieval pipeline that can be built and updated independently via `scripts/build_rag.py`.

**Chunking (`Chunker`):**
- Indexes only high-value prefixes: `script_repository/`, `Base/Python/slicer/`, `Modules/Scripted/`, `Modules/Loadable/*/Testing/Python/`, `Libs/MRML/Core/`, etc.
- Python and C++ files are chunked by AST boundaries (function and class definitions) using tree-sitter.
- Markdown files are chunked by headings; code blocks under a heading stay with it.
- Each chunk's **embedding text** is enriched with the function signature, docstring, source-type label, and a type prefix for better natural-language-to-code matching.

**Embedding (`VectorIndex`):**
- Model: `jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-code` exported to ONNX (~640 MB, downloaded once).
- Runtime: ONNX Runtime with mean-pooling and L2 normalization.
- Tokenizer: Lightweight `tokenizers` library (Rust-based, no heavy `transformers` import).
- Sequence length capped at 1024 tokens.
- Batch encoding with progress logging and ETA estimation.

**Search (`VectorRetriever`):**
- Pure dense search via FAISS `IndexFlatIP` (inner product on normalized vectors = cosine similarity).
- Source-type weighting applied post-search.
- Returns ranked chunks with file path, line range, similarity score, and boosted score.

**Incremental building (`IndexBuilder`):**
- Compares file mtime+size fingerprints against a manifest.
- Re-chunks only changed or new files.
- Rebuilds the FAISS index from the merged chunk list (unchanged + new).
- Stores metadata as JSONL and the manifest as JSON under `Resources/Code_RAG/v1/`.

### 5. Security Model

Generated code is treated as untrusted until validated. The security layers are:

**Blocked modules:** `os`, `subprocess`, `sys`, `socket`, `urllib`, `ctypes`, `pickle`, `marshal`, `imp`, `importlib._bootstrap`, etc.

**Blocked functions:** `eval`, `exec`, `compile`, `open`, `file`, `input`, `getattr`, `setattr`, `globals`, `locals`, `vars`, `dir`, `__import__`, etc.

**Allowed modules:** `slicer`, `vtk`, `qt`, `ctk`, `SampleData`, `numpy`, `SimpleITK`, `sitk`, `json`, `re`, `math`, `random`, `datetime`, `collections`, `itertools`, `io`, `base64`, `hashlib`, `typing`, etc.

**Runtime constraints:**
- No file I/O (`open()` is blocked).
- No network calls.
- No system commands or subprocesses.
- Execution is bounded by a 30-second cooperative timeout.
- The MRML scene can be rolled back on failure.

## Setup & Installation

### 1. Download the Slicer Skill

Follow the download and setup instructions in the [pieper/slicer-skill](https://github.com/pieper/slicer-skill) repository, then place the downloaded skill content under:

```text
Resources/Skills/slicer-skill-full/
```

The agent uses this local folder for documentation search, API lookup, and dense vector retrieval.

### 2. Build the Dense Vector Index (Optional but Recommended)

The vector index enables fast pre-retrieval of relevant knowledge base snippets before each LLM call.

```bash
python scripts/build_rag.py
```

This scans `Resources/Skills/slicer-skill-full/`, chunks changed files, encodes them with the ONNX model, and writes the FAISS index to `Resources/Code_RAG/v1/`. The first run downloads the ~640 MB ONNX model.

### 3. Install the Extension

Add the repository root to Slicer's additional module paths:

1. Open 3D Slicer.
2. Go to **View → Application Settings → Modules → Additional module paths**.
3. Add the root of this repository.
4. Restart Slicer. The module appears under the **AI** category.

### 4. Configure API Key

Enter your API key in the Settings panel of the module UI. Supported providers:

- **Kimi / Moonshot** (default): `https://api.moonshot.cn/v1`, default model `kimi-k2.5`
- **DeepSeek**: OpenAI-compatible DeepSeek endpoints and model list from the provider selector.
- **Claude**: native Anthropic Messages API when using `https://api.anthropic.com/v1`; OpenAI-compatible Claude proxies are also supported when their base URL uses OpenAI-compatible chat completions.

Use the **Test** button to verify the configured provider, model, base URL, and API key.
