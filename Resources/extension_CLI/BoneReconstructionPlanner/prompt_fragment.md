### BoneReconstructionPlanner

Generated CLI package status: validated.

Available tool: `BoneReconstructionPlanner`.

Execute cookbook workflow steps in order. For automated steps, run the returned code. For interactive or mixed steps, run the pre-code, wait for the user to finish the requested interaction, then run the post-code.

Workflow steps:
- `cb_step_1` [user_choice]: 1. If the fibula is from the right leg, tick the "Right side leg" checkbox.
- `cb_step_2` [user_choice]: 2. In the "Select mandibular segmentation" section, choose the mandibular segmentation.
- `cb_step_3` [user_choice]: 3. In the "Select fibula segmentation" section, choose the fibula segmentation.
- `cb_step_4` [user_choice]: 4. For the "Current Scalar Volume" option, select the Mandible Volume.
- `cb_step_5` [automated]: 5. Click "Create bone models from segmentations" button.
- `cb_step_6` [automated]: 6. Change the layout to "Conventional".
- `cb_step_7` [automated]: 7. For the R (red) view, toggle on "slice visibility in 3D view".
- `cb_step_8` [automated]: 8. For the R (red) view, toggle on "FOV, Spacing match 2D" (adjusts slice resolution to match the 2D viewport pixel spacing).
- `cb_step_9` [automated]: 9. In the toolbar, turn on "slice intersection visibility". In the slice intersection interaction options, turn on "set interaction", then enable both "Translate" and "Rotate".
- `cb_step_10` [interactive]: 10. Manually adjust the slice intersection position by translate and rotate of the cross lines in each view.
- `cb_step_11` [automated]: 11. Click the "Add mandibular curve" button.
- `cb_step_12` [automated]: 12. Configure the display settings of the mandibular curve created by the "Add mandibular curve" button so it is shown in both "View 1" and "Red".
- `cb_step_13` [interactive]: 13. Manually click and draw on the "Red" view to create a curve along the mandible.
- `cb_step_14` [automated]: 14. Change the layout to "BoneReconstructionPlanner".
- `cb_step_15` [automated]: 15. For the R (red) view, toggle off "slice visibility in 3D view".
- `cb_step_16` [user_choice]: 16. Manually set how many cut planes you want.
- `cb_step_17` [automated]: 17. Click "Add cut plane" button.
- `cb_step_18` [interactive]: 18. Place one mandibular cut plane using the extension's Add cut plane workflow. If the user requested N cut planes, repeat the Add cut plane + place plane
  interaction N times. Do not store these planes as a rotation plane; they are mandibular cut planes managed by the extension.
- `cb_step_19` [automated]: 19. Click "Add fibula line" button.
- `cb_step_20` [interactive]: 20. Draw a line over the fibula in "3D View 2", starting with the first point distally and the last point proximally.
- `cb_step_21` [automated]: 21. Click "Center fibula line using fibula model" button to align the line with the anatomical axis of the fibula.
- `cb_step_22` [automated]: 22. Click "Update fibula planes over fibula line; update fibula bone pieces and transform them to mandible" to generate the reconstruction and create the fibula cut planes.
